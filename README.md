# Base Ubuntu Desktop

This repository contains the files necessary for building a minimal **Ubuntu desktop** that you can run with:

* Parallels
* Hyper-V
* KVM
* VirtualBox
* VMWare

The configuration file by default includes a Packer post-processor that automatically uploads the image to [VagrantUp](https://vagrantup.com). This compiled box is uploaded to the [ProfessorManhattan/Base-Ubuntu-Desktop](https://app.vagrantup.com/Megabyte/boxes/Ubuntu-Desktop) repository on VagrantUp. If you would like to use this feature (and have your builds automatically uploaded to VagrantUp), you need to set the `VAGRANT_CLOUD_TOKEN` environment variable to your VagrantUp API key and also change the `vagrantup_user` variable in `template.json` to your VagrantUp username.

The operating system is the **desktop version of Ubuntu** so you get a full GUI. The username and password are both *vagrant*.

## Requirements

* Any combination of the above virualization platforms
* Packer
* Vagrant (for spinning up the VM)

## Instructions

After cloning (and setting the `vagrantup_user` variable in `template.json`), go to the root of this project and run:

```
VAGRANT_CLOUD_TOKEN={{ YourTokenHere }}
git submodule update --init --recursive
packer build -only=virtualbox-iso template.json
```

That will build and upload a VirtualBox image to VagrantUp. You can build/upload other variants of the image by replacing `virtualbox-iso` with the types which can be found in the `template.json` file.

## Updating to the Latest Version

We created a side project called [LatestOS](https://pypi.org/project/latestos/). It is a Python module that will automatically grab the latest OS version and populate `template.json` with the results. You can use this in combination with a cron job to automatically have your VagrantUp repository up-to-date with the latest upstream OS release. Further instructions can be found on the [LatestOS page](https://pypi.org/project/latestos/).
